# My Framework

This repository contains the framework project from the microverse curriculum.
In this project i used SASS to create some framework-like classes, while i was building the Odin Project [site](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
To be specific, i did a classic navbar class list-based, that includes a brand name on the right, and your links to the left.
Also did a sizing system with margins and paddings, with values from 1 to 10, that represents em sizes of 0 to 5.
I added some classes of the most common flex uses, like center, and some text common classes, like for font weight, and colors.


Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
